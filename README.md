# Identifying Enron Employees Involved with Fraud using Machine Learning
For Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning Final Project, I have been given the opportunity to apply machine learning algorithms to an imperfect, real-world dataset, and clearly communicate my results.

## Project Deliverables
Viewers can see my findings here:

- **project_report.pdf:** Discussion of the project scope, all analysis, and final results
- **workflow.ipynb:** My workflow reveals all data analysis and deployed machine learning algorithms
- **poi_id.py:** Final algorithm developed to identify fraudulent employees (Run this code)


## Starter Files
Udacity files provided to allow me carry out this project: 

- **enron_exploration.pdf:** Financial data of Enron employees
- **./emails_by_address:** Record of Enron employee email information
- **final_project_dataset.pkl** Pickle file containing structured financial and email data for each employee in this study
- **./tools/feature_format.py:** Contains helper functions that extract features from the provided dataset 
- **tester.py:** Run this code to confirm that the created final algorithm meets Udacity's minimum performance requirements 

## Created Files
These pickle files reveal select information that is relevant to the final algorithm:

- **my_dataset.pkl:** Useful portions of the structured financial and email data
- **my_feature_list:** Features used in the final algorithm 
- **my_classifier:** Best performing machine learning algorithm
